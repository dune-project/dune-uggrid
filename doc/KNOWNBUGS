                       UG bug reports 
                       ==============
(start s.l. 020720) 

Purpose:
    - report known bugs, when using UG 

Structure:
    - bugs are reported in a module by module
      manner, if the buggy module cannot be determined
	  take the general section to report the bug.

Extensions:
    - evereyone using UG is welcome to contribute with
	  bugs one knows 
    - please document all problems, also shortcomings in
	  command parameter evaluation, etc., which
	  lead to misconfiguration and script errors.

Bug description:
	- first give a short description of the bug and the
		error message you get.
	- if possible report a program stack, to see in which
		function the bug occurs.
	- if the bug is reproducable, describe all information
		to do that: date,application, used script, 
	- if the bug is NOT reproduceable, but you
		are sure it is a bug categorize it with
		NOT REPRODUCABLE.

Mantainance:
    - bugs should be resolved and removed once or twice a year

ugpfm:
Bug description: after merging parallel data files, solution values probably at
	processor boundaries are wrong.
	This might also be bug in UG/ug/gm/ugio.c.

Applikation: d3f
Skript: init.scr (with savedata switched on), df_run.scr


UG/ug/ui/

dataexplorer:
Bug description: The dataexplorer command can fail in parallel mode if the buffer 
	size PFILE_BUFFER_SIZE in pfile.h is too small.  You will see either a 
	timeout error, crash or message truncation error, depending on the circumstances.
	The problem is that each process will write its segment into the buffer before the
	segments are collected and then written by the master.  If the buffer is too small,
	this fails.

Bug fix (hack): Increase the size of PFILE_BUFFER_SIZE until the command suceeds.
	A permanent solution should probably determine the buffer size dynamically,
	but could then be unable to allocate enough memory.
