alignment/non-alignment of buffer pointers.
960919 kb
The handlers for gathering/scattering data during IF-communication
are called with non-aligned pointers into the buffer. Therefore,
the application program can send n bytes per object in the interface
without wasting message buffer space.
However, the handlers for gathering/scattering data objects into
messages during Xfer (caused by calling DDD_XferAddData()) are called
with aligned pointers. This is due to allow access to the copy of
the data object inside the message buffer (which correct alignments).
