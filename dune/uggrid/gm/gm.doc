/** \struct domain

The DOMAIN structure describes a two- or three-dimensional domain. This geometry
information is used by UG when it refines a grid, i.e. complex geometries are approximated
better when the grid is refined. The DOMAIN structure is a directory in the
environment tree (see ENVIRONMENT in the ug/low section). 

A domain is made up of one or several `boundary segments` which are defined by the
BOUNDARY_SEGMENT (see that page) structure. 
The BOUNDARY_SEGMENT objects are stored in the environment
tree in the corresponding DOMAIN. The points where boundary segments join are
called corners of the domain. For each corner a NODE is automatically created.

Domains are created with the function CreateDomain.

. d - Makes the DOMAIN an environment directory. d stores also the name of
the domain.

. numOfSegments -  Gives the number of BOUNDARY_SEGMENT structures that
will define the domain. 

. numOfCorners - Number of corners defined by the domain.

MACROS:

The components of the DOMAIN structure are only read internally. The
user only creates domains with the function CreateDomain. Therefore
no access macros are provided.

EXAMPLES:

The following code fragment shows the definition of a simple two-dimensional
domain. The domain is the unit circle defined by two boundary segments, the
upper half circle and the lower half circle. Therefore the domain has two
corners, two boundary segments and one subdomain (the domain itself).

The following two functions of type BndSegFuncPtr define the
mapping for the upper and lower half circle respectively.

\verbatim
// circleBoundary maps [0.0,1.0] to the upper half circle
static INT circleBoundaryUpper (void *data, DOUBLE *param, DOUBLE *result)
{
    DOUBLE lambda;

    // retrieve parameter value 
    lambda = param[0];

    // check range
    if ((lambda<0.0)||(lambda>1.0)) return(1);

    // fill result 
    result[0] = cos(PI*lambda); // x  PI defined in misc.h 
    result[1] = sin(PI*lambda); // y 

    // return ok 
    return(0);
}

// circleBoundary maps [0.0,1.0] to the lower half circle
static INT circleBoundaryLower (void *data, DOUBLE *param, DOUBLE *result)
{
    DOUBLE lambda;

    // retrieve parameter value 
    lambda = param[0];

    // check range 
    if ((lambda<0.0)||(lambda>1.0)) return(1);

    // fill result 
    result[0] = cos(PI+PI*lambda); // x  PI defined in misc.h 
    result[1] = sin(PI+PI*lambda); // y 

    // return ok 
    return(0);
}
\endverbatim

The following function InitUnitCircle uses the functions
CreateDomain and CreateBoundarySegment in order to create
a domain and the list of boundary segments for that domain.

\verbatim
static INT InitUnitCircle (void)
{
    // allocate new domain structure 
    if (CreateDomain(
            "circle",               // name of the new domain

       )==NULL) return(1);

/*! \struct boundary_segment
 \brief Data structure defining part of the boundary of a domain

STRUCTURES:

\verbatim
typedef INT (*BndSegFuncPtr) (void *,DOUBLE *,DOUBLE *);

typedef struct boundary_segment BOUNDARY_SEGMENT;
\endverbatim

DESCRIPTION:

A domain for UG is described as a set of boundary segments defined
by the BOUNDARY_SEGMENT structure. Each boundary segment is a mapping
from `d`-1 dimensional parameter space to `d` dimensional eucledian space.
The parameter space is an interval [a,b] in two dimensions or a rectangle
[a,b]x[c,d] in three dimensional applications.

`2D boundary segments`
\verbatim
      0        1
      +--------+     maps [a,b] to R x R
      a        b
\endverbatim

`3D boundary segments`

      |        |
      |0      1|
    c +--------+
      a        b
\endverbatim


For all boundary segments the points in `d` dimensional space corresponding to the parameters
a and b in two dimensions ((a,c),(a,d),(b,c),(b,d) in three dimensions)
are called `corners` of the domain. Locally for each boundary segment the
corners are numbered like shown in the figures above.
The corners are numbered `globally` in a consecutive way beginning with 0.
`CAUTION:` boundary segments must be defined in such a way that no two
corners are identical!

In two dimensions `internal boundary
segments` can be defined in order to divide the domain into `subdomains`
having different materials for example. The subdomains are numbered consecutively
beginning with 1. By default the exterior of the domain has number 0.

Boundary segments are created with the function CreateBoundarySegment.

. v - The BOUNDARY_SEGMENT structure is an environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT),
therefore it has the ENVVAR v as its first component. v stores also the
name of the boundary segment.

. left,right - Numbers of left and right subdomain. The right subdomain is where the
normal vector of the curve points to in a right handed coordinate system. The TeX
version of this page contains two figures for clarification. 
In 2D it is simple: Walk along the curve in direction of increasing parameter
values and look to the right. There is the right subdomain. In 3D the rule
is as follows. Let the thumb point in direction of increasing values
of the first parameter, let the index finger point in direction of
increasing values of the second parameter, then the middle finger
points to the right subdomain.  

. id - Number of the boundary segment beginning with zero.

. segType - Type of boundary segment. Currently only NON_PERIODIC is
allowed. Later periodic boundary segments will be implemented.

. points - Mapping of local numbers of corners to global numbers. Remember, all
global numbers of corners must be different. The local numbering scheme can
be seen from the figures above.

. resolution - Parameter indicating the curvature of the boundary segment. This is
used mainly by the graphics module in order plot a boundary segment. For
straight lines 1 is sufficient.

. alpha,beta - Defines the parameter space. In 2D this is the interval
[alpha[0],beta[0]], in 3D this is the rectangle 
[alpha[0],beta[0]] x [alpha[1],beta[1]] (or a=alpha[0], b=beta[0],
c=alpha[1], d=beta[1] in the figure above.

. BndSegFunc - Pointer to a C function describing the mapping from parameter
space to the `d`-space. This function must be of type BndSegFuncPtr.
(see below).

. data - User defined pointer. This pointer is passed as the first
argument to the BndSegFunc of the segment. This pointer can be used
to construct an interface to geometry data files, e.g. from a CAD system.

. BndSegFuncPtr - Data type of the functions mapping parameter space to
`d`-space. The first argument of type void * is the user data pointer from
the corresponding BOUNDARY_SEGMENT. The second parameter of type DOUBLE *
provides an array containing the parameters where the boundary segment
function should be evaluated (one number in 2D, two numbers in 3D). The
third parameter of type DOUBLE * provides an array where the result can be placed
(x,y values in 2D, x,y,z values in 3D).

MACROS:

The components of the BOUNDARY_SEGMENT structure are accessed through
the BNDSEGDESC structure, see that man page.

/*! \struct problem

STRUCTURES:

\verbatim
typedef INT (*CoeffProcPtr) (DOUBLE *, DOUBLE *);
typedef INT (*UserProcPtr) (DOUBLE *, DOUBLE *);
typedef INT (*ConfigProcPtr) (INT argc, char **argv);


typedef struct problem PROBLEM ;
\endverbatim

DESCRIPTION:

The PROBLEM data type is used to give a complete description
of the pde to be solved. Since this is a UG data type and UG is
independent of the pde to be solved it must be a very general mechanism.
The abstraction is that a problem is completely described by
(1) The domain, (2) the pde, (3) coefficient functions for the pde
and (4) boundary conditions. The first two items are handled easily.
When creating a PROBLEM then the name of a DOMAIN has to be passed
as a parameter (see example below). The pde to be solved is determined
by the problem class library that is linked to the UG library. In order
to be sure that a problem description and the problem class library
are intended for the same pde, each problem class library exports
in identification number that has to coincide with the
number given in the problem description. Problems are created by
the function CreateProblem.

. CoeffProcPtr - This function gets a DOUBLE and a DOUBLE array, which are usually
called in and out. These functions are only called by the problem class
libraries, therefore the length of these arrays and the use of their entries
is not determined by UG. UG only stores pointers to these user definable functions!

. UserProcPtr - Same as a CoeffProcPtr but both arrays are of type DOUBLE *.

. ConfigProcPtr - Problem configuration function which is called be the UG command
reinit. Parameters argc, argv are those passed to the function implementing
the reinit command. This function can be used to change a parameter in the
problem description from the shell. E.g. the Reynolds number is a parameter in a
Navier-Stokes calculation. One could write a configuration functions that reads
the Reynolds number from the command line of the reinit command or from
a UG shell variable.


MACROS:

\verbatim
INT PROBLEMID (PROBLEM *p);
\endverbatim
Extracts the problem identification number from a problem.

\verbatim
ConfigProcPtr CONFIGFUNC (PROBLEM *p);
\endverbatim
Returns a pointer to the configuration function of the problem.

\verbatim
INT NUMCOEFF (PROBLEM *p); 
\endverbatim
Returns the number of coefficient functions defined in the problem description.

\verbatim
INT NUMUSERFCT (PROBLEM *p);
\endverbatim
Returns the number of user functions in the problem description.

\verbatim
CoeffProcPtr COEFFFUNC (PROBLEM *p,INT i); 
\endverbatim
Returns a pointer to the i-th coefficient function of the problem.
The meaning of coefficient function i is determined by the problem class
library.

\verbatim
UserProcPtr USERFUNC (PROBLEM *p,INT i);
\endverbatim
Returns a pointer to the i-th user function of the problem.
The meaning of user function i is determined by the problem class
library.

typedef struct bndcond BOUNDARY_CONDITION ;

DESCRIPTION:

The data type BOUNDARY_CONDITION is used to specify boundary
conditions. This is done in the same way as a domain is defined.
For each boundary segment there must be a corresponding boundary
condition function that specifies the boundary conditions along that
segment. The same parametrization is used for the boundary segment function
and the boundary condition function. The BOUNDARY_CONDITION data structure
stores a pointer to that function and some additional information.

. v - A BOUNDARY_CONDITION is an environment variable which is stored
in the directory given by the corresponding PROBLEM object. v stores
also the name of the boundary condition.

. id - Number of the corresponding boundary segment. Boundary segments
and boundary conditions with the same id are accessible via a BNDSEGDESC
structure.

. BndCond - Pointer to a function of type BndCondProcPtr defining the
boundary condition for a segment.

. data - user definable pointer that is passed as first argument to BndCond
when it is called.

The components of the BOUNDARY_CONDITION structure are only accessible
through the BNDSEGDESC structure during computations. See the MACROS

typedef union vertex VERTEX;
\endverbatim

DESCRIPTION:

The VERTEX structure stores the level independent information of
a NODE. If several NODEs on different levels of the MULTIGRID structure
are at the same position then they share a common VERTEX object.
The VERTEX is a union of inner vertex ivertex and boundary vertex bvertex.
The bvertex has all of the ivertex plus some extra information where
the vertex is on the boundary of the domain. In the code one always works with
pointers of type VERTEX * and accesses the components through the macros described
below.

. control - As in almost all UG objects this word is used bitwise for various
purposes (see section below).

. id - Each vertex is given a unique identification number at creation.

. x - Vector with `global` coordinates.

. xi - Vector with `local` coordinates. This is used to represent the multigrid
hierarchy. The father component points to an ELEMENT of the next coarser
grid level and xi gives the position of the VERTEX within this element in
the local coordinate system of the ELEMENT. In this way also loosely coupled
grids can be represented although the grid refinement algorithm is currently
not able to produce such grids. The solvers however would work
also on much more general multigrid hierarchies.

. pred,succ - Pointers realizing a double linked list of VERTEX objects per level.
The beginning of this list is in the GRID structure.

. data - pointer to a data space of user definable size.

. father - Pointer to an ELEMENT of the next coarser level. This component is
used for multigrid interpolation and restriction (see also xi component above).
For the vertices in the coarsest grid (level 0) this pointer is NULL.

. topnode - If several NODES share this VERTEX then this pointer refers
to the NODE on the highest level. This pointer will probably `not` be supported
in the next version, its use is not recommended!

MACROS:

\verbatim
INT ID (VERTEX *p);
\endverbatim
Returns VERTEX id.

\verbatim
VERTEX *PREDV (VERTEX *p);
VERTEX *SUCCV (VERTEX *p);
\endverbatim

in both directions.

\verbatim
DOUBLE *CVECT (VERTEX *p);
DOUBLE XC (VERTEX *p);
DOUBLE YC (VERTEX *p);
DOUBLE ZC (VERTEX *p);
\endverbatim
CVECT returns the array of global coordinates (i.e. a pointer) and XC, YC and
ZC return the individual components. Accessing the `z`-coordinate in a 2D application
will not lead to an error message!

\verbatim
DOUBLE *LCVECT (VERTEX *p);
DOUBLE XI (VERTEX *p);

DOUBLE NU (VERTEX *p);
\endverbatim
LCVECT returns the array of local coordinates with the father element and the other

\verbatim
void *VDATA (VERTEX *p);
\endverbatim
Returns the pointer to user data space.

\verbatim
ELEMENT *VFATHER (VERTEX *p);
\endverbatim
Returns the pointer an ELEMENT of the next coarser grid level containing the 
given VERTEX. A NULL pointer indicates that the VERTEX is on level 0, the
coarsest level.

\verbatim
NODE *TOPNODE (VERTEX *p);
\endverbatim
Returns pointer to the highest NODE using that VERTEX. The use of this
component is not recommended since it will not be supported in the future.

DESCRIPTION:

Each node of the mesh is represented by a NODE structure. When a mesh is refined
then new NODE objects are allocated on the new grid level
even at those positions where nodes were already in the coarse mesh. However, NODEs
at the same position share a common VERTEX structure.
A node provides access to all neighboring nodes via the LINK structure. There
is `no` access from a node to all the elements having the node as a corner!

. control - As in almost all UG objects this word is used bitwise for various
purposes.

. id - Each node is assigned a unique identification number when it is created.

. index - The index indicates the position of the node in the node list. 
This component is provided mainly for compatibility reasons.

. pred,succ - All nodes of one grid level are in a double linked list.

. start - Points to the first element of the LINK list. The LINK list
provides access to all neighbors of the node.

. father,son - All nodes at the same position in the multigrid structure, i.e.
sharing a common VERTEX are connected by a double linked list providing access to
the node on the next coarser (father) and finer (son) grid levels.

. myvertex - Pointer to the VERTEX associated with the node.

. vector - Pointer to a VECTOR containing degrees of freedom associated with the node.

LINK - Data type realizing a list of neighbors of a node

STRUCTURES:

struct link {

    // variables 
    unsigned INT control;       // object identification, various flags 
    struct link *next;          // ptr to next link                     
    struct node *nbnode;        // ptr to neighbor node                 
} ;

typedef struct link LINK;
\endverbatim

DESCRIPTION:

The LINK structures form a single linked list starting in each NODE.
Two nodes are said to be neighbors if they are connected by an edge `in the mesh`.
Note that this is only the geometric neighborship, which can be different from the
algebraic neighborship derived from the non-zero structure of the global stiffness matrix.
Each LINK provides a pointer to one neighbor of the NODE where the list
starts. The neighbor relationship is symmetric, therefore if node `a` is a neighbor
of node `b` then `a` occurs in the list of `b` and vice versa. These two link structures
are then combined in an EDGE structure.

. control - As in almost all UG objects this word is used bitwise for various
purposes.

. next - pointer to next LINK object.

. nbnode - Pointer to neighboring node.

MACROS:

\verbatim
NODE *NBNODE (LINK *p);
\endverbatim 

Returns pointer to a neighboring node that is stored in the LINK.

\verbatim
LINK *NEXT (LINK *p);
\endverbatim

Returns pointer to next LINK in the list. As usual a NULL pointer indicates
the end of the list.

\verbatim
EDGE *MYEDGE (LINK *p);
\endverbatim

Provides access to the EDGE where this given LINK is part of. 

\verbatim
LINK *REVERSE (LINK *p);
\endverbatim

Macro that provides fast access to the LINK in the reverse direction.
If the given LINK connects node `a` with node `b`, then REVERSE
provides the LINK in the list of node `b` pointing to `a`.

DESCRIPTION:

The EDGE data type combines LINK structures to form an `undirected`
connection of two NODEs. An EDGE represents an edge of the mesh.
Degrees of freedom can be associated with EDGEs as it is necessary in
quadratic, non-conforming or mixed finite elements.

. links - Array of two LINKs. In that way LINKs are always allocated pairwise
and in consecutive memory locations. This allows to switch easily from a given
LINK to the LINK in reverse direction or to the EDGE.

. midnode - In 3D a pointer to the node created on the midpoint of an edge is
needed during refinement (This is because many elements share an edge in 3D).

. vector - Pointer to a VECTOR structure of appropriate size declared in the
FORMAT.

MACROS:

\verbatim
LINK *LINK0 (EDGE *p);
\endverbatim

Pointer to first LINK of an EDGE.

\verbatim
LINK *LINK1 (EDGE *p);

DESCRIPTION:

UG provides a flexible element concept, i.e. there may be different
types of elements in a mesh (currently limited to 8). All element types are derived
from the generic_element where the refs array is allocated to the
appropriate length. Data types for the currently implemented three different
elements triangle, quadrilateral and tetrahedron are provided only
for illustration and debugging purposes. Internally only the generic_element
is used. The TAG field in the control word is used to identify the
element type at run-time, therefore the limitation to eight element types.
Memory requirements are also higher for elements having at least one
side on the boundary because additional pointers to boundary information
is stored.
In 3D, degrees of freedom can be associated also with the sides of an element.
Since there is no data type to represent sides, the degrees of freedom associated
with a side of an element are accessed via the element (a side is shared by exactly
two elements, UG ensures the consistency of the pointers).

. control - As in almost all UG objects this word is used bitwise for various
purposes.

. id - Each element has a unique id.

. flag - A lot of information requiring only a small number of bits must be stored
for each element. Therefore a second control word, the flag, has been introduced.
The flag is also used bitwise.

. property - Since control and flag were full, a third word had to be introduced that
can be used bitwise. A part of this word stores the element property, which is simple
a number per element. This number can be used to distinguish different materials
for example.

. pred,succ - All elements of a grid level are connected by a double linked list.

. n - Array of pointers to the corner NODEs of an element.

. father - Pointer to element on the next coarser grid level that created 
the given element during refinement.

. sons - Array of pointers to elements on the next finer grid level that
have been created by refining the given element. In 2D all sons
are directly accessible, in 3D only one pointer is stored and a complete
list of sons is constructed by the function GetSons.

. nb - Array of pointers to neighboring elements. There are as many neighbors
as the element has sides.

. vector - Pointer to VECTOR that is associated with the element. Whether degrees
of freedom are allowed to be associated with elements is determined at compile-time
through appropriate makefile switches.

. sidevector - Array of pointers to VECTORs associated with the sides of an element.
This option is available only in 3D. Whether VECTORs are allowed in sides is determined
through switches in the makefiles at compile-time.

MACROS:

\verbatim
INT SIDES_OF_ELEM (ELEMENT *p);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of sides of a given element. In 2D the number of sides and number
of edges of an element coincide. The nb, sidevector and side
arrays are of this size.

\verbatim
INT EDGES_OF_ELEM (ELEMENT *p);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of edges of a given element. In 2D the number of sides and number
of edges of an element coincide.

\verbatim
INT CORNERS_OF_ELEM (ELEMENT *p);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of corners of a given element. This is also the size of the n
array.

\verbatim
INT SONS_OF_ELEM (ELEMENT *p);
\endverbatim

Returns the maximum number of sons possible for a given element. This is the
size of the sons array in 2D. The actual number of sons depends on the refinement
rule that has been applied to the element and is given by the NSONS macro
(see CONTROL WORDS section below).

\verbatim
INT EDGES_OF_SIDE (ELEMENT *p,INT i);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of edges of side i of the given element. In 2D a side has always one
edge since edges and sides coincide.

\verbatim
INT CORNERS_OF_SIDE (ELEMENT *p,INT i);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of corners of side i of the given element.

\verbatim
#define CORNERS_OF_EDGE 2
\endverbatim

This definition is provided only to make the description complete.

`The following macros determine the numbering scheme of an element. In each
element type the corners, edges and sides are numbered beginning with zero.
Each side again has a local numbering of its edges and corners and each edge
has a local numbering of its corners. We then need mappings of the numbering
scheme within edges and sides to the numbering scheme within the element.`

\verbatim
INT EDGE_OF_SIDE (ELEMENT *p,INT s,INT e);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of edge e of side s within the element p.

\verbatim
INT CORNER_OF_SIDE (ELEMENT *p,INT s,INT c);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of corner c of side s within the element p.

\verbatim
INT CORNER_OF_EDGE (ELEMENT *p,INT e,INT c);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of corner c of edge e within the element p.

\verbatim
INT EDGE_WITH_CORNERS (ELEMENT *p,INT c0,INT c1);
\endverbatim

Returns the number of the edge (with respect to numbering in the element p)
that connects corners with numbers c0 and c1 (with respect to numbering in
element p).

\verbatim
INT SIDE_WITH_EDGE (ELEMENT *p,INT e,INT k);
\endverbatim

SIDE_WITH_EDGE(p,e,0) and SIDE_WITH_EDGE(p,e,1) delivers the numbers
of the two sides (with respect to numbering in p) that share edge number e
(also with respect to the element).

\verbatim
INT CORNER_OF_SIDE_INV (ELEMENT *p,INT s,INT c);
\endverbatim

When c is the number of a corner and s is the number of a side
(both with respect to numbering in the element) then 
CORNER_OF_SIDE_INV returns the number of corner c with respect
to the numbering in side s or -1 if s does not contain corner c.

\verbatim
INT EDGES_OF_CORNER (ELEMENT *p,INT c,INT k);
\endverbatim

If c is the number of a corner with respect to numbering within
the element then EDGES_OF_CORNER(p,c,k) returns all numbers
of edges (with respect to p) that are connected to corner c.
Since this number is variable a value of -1 identifies an invalid entry.
The edges are numbered consecutively, i.e. if a -1 is encountered
larger values of k (less than EDGES_OF_ELEM(p)) will lead also to -1).

\verbatim
INT SUCCE (ELEMENT *p);
INT PREDE (ELEMENT *p);
\endverbatim

Return pointers to next and previous element of the double linked list of elements per level.

\verbatim
NODE *CORNER (ELEMENT *p,INT i);
\endverbatim

Returns a pointer to corner i of element p. i should be less than
CORNERS_OF_ELEM(p).

\verbatim
ELEMENT *EFATHER (ELEMENT *p);
\endverbatim

Returns a pointer to the father element.

\verbatim
ELEMENT *SON (ELEMENT *p,INT i);
\endverbatim

Returns a pointer to son i of p in the element hierarchy. In 3D only i=0 is
allowed and the function GetSons should be used instead. i should be
smaller than NSONS(p).

\verbatim
ELEMENT *NBELEM (ELEMENT *p,INT i);
\endverbatim

Returns a pointer to neighboring element over side i. i should be less
than SIDES_OF_ELEM(p).

\verbatim
VECTOR *EVECTOR (ELEMENT *p);
\endverbatim

Returns a pointer to the VECTOR associated with the element. This
pointer is only available if the appropriate switches in the makefiles
have been set for element vectors.

\verbatim
VECTOR *SVECTOR (ELEMENT *p,INT i);
\endverbatim

Returns a pointer to the VECTOR associated with the side i
of element p. i must be less than SIDES_OF_ELEM(p). This
pointer is only available if the appropriate switches in the makefiles
have been set for side vectors.

/*! \struct vector

 \brief Data type for unknowns in sparse matrix structure


The VECTOR data type is part of the sparse matrix vector data structure.
A VECTOR stores a user definable number of DOUBLE values (see FORMAT) and
is associated with a geometric object of the mesh (nodes, edges, sides and elements).
The size of the VECTOR can be specified differently for each type of
geometric object, but not (yet) for each individual VECTOR object.
Since there are four different geometric objects that can have degrees
of freedom, there are four different `vector types`. The vector type
is stored in the control word (see VTYPE macro) and can have the
following values

\verbatim
    NODEVECTOR 
    EDGEVECTOR 
    SIDEVECTOR
    ELEMVECTOR
\endverbatim

The VECTOR provides access to the rows of the sparse matrix belonging to
all degrees of freedom stored in the vector.

/*! \struct matrix
 \brief Data type realizing sparse matrix structure

The MATRIX data type is part of UGs sparse matrix vector data structure.
A MATRIX stores all the matrix entries coupling two VECTORs (which can be identical - this
is the case for diagonal entries).
The number of entries in a MATRIX depends on the geometrical position
of the source and destination VECTOR, i.e. a MATRIX coupling
a VECTOR in NODE with a VECTOR in another NODE can have a different
size than a MATRIX coupling a VECTOR in a NODE with a
VECTOR in an EDGE.
The MATRIX structure forms a single linked list that contains all
couplings of the VECTOR where the list starts (see the VSTART macro
there). The list `always` starts with the diagonal element.
Except for diagonal MATRIX entries two MATRIX objects are combined to
build a CONNECTION object.

MACROS:

\verbatim
MATRIX *MINC (MATRIX *m);
\endverbatim

Adds sizeof(MATRIX) to m (of course the dynamic size of m).

\verbatim
MATRIX *MDEC (MATRIX *m);
\endverbatim

Subtracts sizeof(MATRIX) to m (of course the dynamic size of m).

\verbatim
MATRIX *MNEXT (MATRIX *m);
\endverbatim

Returns pointer to next MATRIX in the list.

\verbatim
VECTOR *MDEST (MATRIX *m);
\endverbatim

Returns pointer to destination VECTOR, i.e. the column VECTOR. If m is an element
of the MATRIX list of some VECTOR `a` and MDEST(m)=`b`, then m contains
all the matrix entries of rows belonging `a` and columns belonging to `b`.
 
\verbatim
MATRIX *MADJ (MATRIX *m);
\endverbatim

Returns a pointer to the transposed MATRIX, i.e. if m couples VECTOR
`a` with VECTOR `b`, then MADJ(m) couples `b` with `a`.

\verbatim
CONNECTION *MMYCON (MATRIX *m);
\endverbatim

Returns a pointer to the CONNECTION where m is part of.

/*! \struct multigrid
 * \brief Data type representing a complete multigrid structure


Data type providing access to all information about the complete
multigrid hierarchy, problem description and memory management information.
This is the root of all.

. v - The MULTIGRID is an environment item, i.e. it resides in the environment
tree. v stores also the name of the MULTIGRID as it is declared in the new
and open commands.

. vertIdCounter,nodeIdCounter,elemIdCounter - Counters used to assign unique
identification numbers to VERTEX, NODE and ELEMENT objects. The counter
wraps around after 2 to the power of 32 objects have been allocated!

. topLevel - Finest grid level currently allocated in the MULTIGRID.

. currentLevel - Any number between 0 and topLevel. The currentLevel
is used by many commands that work on a grid level as default value. It can
be changed with the level command from the UG shell. 

. theDomain - Pointer to a DOMAIN structure that is to be used for the
mesh described by the MULTIGRID.

. theFormat - Pointer to a FORMAT structure describing all parameters
of the UG data structure that can be selected at run-time.  Especially
there are a lot of user definable data spaces in the basic objects.

. theProblem - Pointer to a PROBLEM structure giving access to the
user defined coefficient functions and boundary conditions that are
appropriate for the selected problem class.

. numOfSegments - Number of BNDSEGDESC structures accessible in the segments
array. This corresponds to the number of boundary segments in theDomain.

. numOfSegments - Number of subdomains, used for the grid generator.

. segments - Array of BNDSEGDESC structures. Index `i` in that array corresponds
to boundary segment `i`.

. corners - Array of pointers to VERTEX structures that are allocated at the
`corners` of theDomain. 

. numOfCorners - Number of corners of theDomain. This is also the size of the
corners array.

. theHeap - Pointer to a HEAP structure allocated for that MULTIGRID. The size
of this heap is selected with the open or new commands.

. grids - Array of pointers to GRID structures representing the individual
levels of the multigrid hierarchy.

. freeObjects - List of free objects sorted by object number. Memory management in
UG is such that new memory for an object is only allocated when no free object of the requested type
is available. If an object is no longer needed (e.g. when coarsening a mesh) it is
inserted in the appropriate list of free objects.

. freeVectors,freeConnections - List of free VECTOR and CONNECTION
objects sorted by type. Same comment as for freeObjects applies.

. GenData - Management of general user data space in multigrid. At initialisation time
different modules can (pre)allocate storage which will (actually) be allocated in
each multigrid when it is opened. Storage is allocated and addressed by calls of
DefineMGUDBlock and GetMGUDBlockDescriptor resp. See also the macros below.
